# Weather App

The Weather App is a mobile application built using Flutter. It provides users with the current weather information based on their location, along with the weather forecast for the previous 2 days and the next 5 days. The app uses geolocation to determine the user's location, GetX state management to manage the app's state, Dio for network requests, Google Fonts for font customization, Intl for internationalization, and follows the MVP (Model-View-Presenter) architecture pattern.
